            We may serve ads on our Services or on external services
            and engage and work with Service Providers and other third parties to serve advertisements on the Services
            and/or on Third-Party Services. Some of these ads may be tailored to your interests based on your browsing,
            across time, of the Services and elsewhere on the Internet, which may include use of data from cross-device
            usage, sometimes referred to as "interest-based advertising" and "online behavioral
            advertising" ("Interest-based Advertising"), which may include sending you an ad on a
            third-party service after you have left the Services (i.e., "retargeting"). Our advertisers'
            and ad networks' use of Tracking Technologies are governed by their own privacy policies

            We may use Tracking Technologies to collect information
            about interactions with the Services, including information about your browsing and purchasing behavior.
            Tracking Technologies make Web-surfing and browsing easier for you by saving your preferences so that we can use

                Regular cookies may generally be disabled or
                removed by tools available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some instances blocked in the
                future by selecting certain settings. Browsers offer different functionalities and options so you may
                need to set them separately. Also, tools from commercial browsers may not be effective with regard to
                some Tracking Technologies, such as HTML5 cookies. Please be aware that if you disable or remove these
                technologies, some parts of the Services may not work and that when you revisit the Services your
                ability to limit browser-based Tracking Technologies is subject to your browser settings and
                limitations.
            </li>
            <li>
                Some App-related Tracking Technologies in
                connection with non-browser usage (e.g., most functionality of a mobile app) can only be disabled by
                uninstalling the app. To uninstall an app, follow the instructions from your operating system or handset
                manufacturer. Apple and Google mobile device settings have settings to limit ad tracking, and other
                tracking, but these may not be completely effective.

            <li>
                Your browser settings may allow you to
                automatically transmit a "Do Not Track" signal to online services you visit. Note, however,
                there is no consensus among industry participants as to what "Do Not Track" means in this
                context. Like many online services, we currently do not alter our practices when we receive a "Do
                Not Track" signal from a visitor's browser. To find out more about "Do Not
                Track," you can visit <a href="http://www.allaboutdnt.com/">http://www.allaboutdnt.com</a>, but we
                are not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of this third-party information. You have the right
                to request information from us about the Services that currently do not respond to "do not
                track" mechanisms featured in any Internet browser by contacting us according to the "How to

                Many advertisers and service providers that
                perform advertising-related services for us and third parties participate in voluntary programs that
                provide tools to opt-out of such interest-based advertising such as the Digital Advertising
                Alliance's ("DAA") Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn
                more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding interest-based advertising for DAA members,

                Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt
                out of certain kinds of Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads.
                Opting out only means that those selected, participating members should no longer deliver certain
                interest-based advertising to you but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content
                and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when
                you visit these opt-out webpages, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different device or web
                browser or use a non-browser-based method of access (e.g., mobile app), your browser-based opt-out may
                not, or may no longer, be effective.

                interest-based advertising will do so as well, though we cannot guarantee their compliance. We are not

                programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.

            <li>
                In addition, we may serve ads on third-party
                services that are targeted to reach people on those services that are also identified on one or more of
                our databases ("Matched List Ads"). This is done by using Tracking Technologies, or by
                matching common factors between our databases and the databases of the third-party services. We are not
                responsible for these third-party services, including without limitation their security of the data. We
                are not responsible for such third parties' failure to comply with your or our opt-out
                instructions as they may not give us notice of opt-outs to our ads that you give to them, and they may
                change their options without notice to us or you. For more information, please see the selling and

            Cross Border Transfers of Personal Data
        </h4>

        <p>
            Learneo businesses are located in the United States, Israel, India, The
            Netherlands, and Canada and may continue to grow in other countries. We also have service providers both in the
            United States and throughout the world. As such, Learneo and our service providers may transfer your personal data
            to, or access it in, jurisdictions that may not provide equivalent levels of data protection as your home
            jurisdiction. These transfers are necessary in order for us to provide our Services. When we transfer information
            about individuals based in the EEA or UK outside of those countries, we will take appropriate measures to safeguard
            the transfer as required by applicable law, including:
            </p><ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Adequacy Decisions</strong>: European Commission decisions recognizing
                    that certain countries and territories outside of the EEA ensure an adequate level of protection for personal data.
                    Depending on your use of our Services, when we transfer your personal data from the EEA to Israel or the UK, we rely
                    on the European Commission's adequacy decision for Israel and the UK. Further, where we transfer your personal data
                    from the EEA to an US recipient participating in the DPF (including the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy
                    Framework (DPF), where applicable), we rely on the European Commission's adequacy decision for the US.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Standard Contractual Clauses</strong>: Transfers to countries that don't have an adequacy decision typically take place on the basis of the European Commission-approved standard contractual data protection clauses (together with the UK Annex
                    for transfers from the UK), which we use for transfers to countries including but not limited to the US (where the
                    recipient does not participate in the DPF), and Singapore.
                </li>
            </ul>
        <p></p>
        
        
        <p>
            In certain circumstances, cross border transfers may take place on the basis of exemptions provided for under
            applicable data protection law.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            You may always contact us to request a copy of the transfer measures that we have taken to safeguard the transfer of
            your personal data.

                        If you apply to be a tutor, using the information above we
                        will verify your identity as part of your tutor application review. We may also verify your identity when
                        you withdraw funds from your tutor account or to protect your account when we detect fraudulent activity. To
                        verify your identity, we will collect your mobile phone number for SMS verification, an image of your photo ID
                        (such as your driver's license or other government ID; excluding passport), as well as a photo of
                        yourself. If your professional license is issued by a government, and/or you provide a government-issued
                        professional license card, we will verify the authenticity of that information with the relevant government.

                        and the process for verifying your identity with them. Any of the identification service providers we use
                        will only process your personal information at our instruction and for the purposes of verifying your identity

                        information for longer and for other legitimate purposes, including if doing so is necessary to comply with our
                        legal obligations, enforcing and preventing violations of our Terms, to fight spam, protecting or defending our

                        that information would not identify you personally. Applicable storage periods are determined on a case-by-case
                        basis.  To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider applicable
                        legal requirements, the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm
                        from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes we process your personal
                        information for, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means. We will maintain certain types
                        of personal information for a limited duration.  For example, we keep account information, like your name,
                        email address, and password, for as long as your account is in existence because we need it to operate your
                        account.

                        Except as otherwise permitted or required by applicable

                        In some cases, we retain personal
                        information for longer and for other legitimate purposes, including if doing so is necessary to comply with our
                        legal obligations, enforcing and preventing violations of our Terms, to fight spam, protecting or defending our

                        that information would not identify you personally. Applicable storage periods are determined on a case-by-case
                        basis.  
                        To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider applicable
                        legal requirements, the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm
                        from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes we process your personal
                        information for, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means. We will maintain certain types
                        of personal information for a limited duration.  
                        For example, we keep account information, like your name,

                        When you use QuillBot's browser extensions, the

                        documents you create, search queries, and text you input on multiline fields on websites you visit ("Your
                        Content"), as transmitted by you in connection with your use of our extension, will be used in real time
                        on our machine learning algorithm to generate outputs, after which Your Content is deleted from our Services. We
                        only store Your Content after you provide your consent, which you can revoke at any time within the

                        Privacy Policy) of any command that you provide to QuillBot to perform a specific function. For example, when
                        you provide the command "Write an email for a business proposal," we will store that text and the
                        metadata associated with it, including your personal data like your QuillBot account and browser information. We
                        use the Command Data we store to understand usage, optimize our Services, and provide the best experience on

                        received), documents you create, search queries, and text you enter in multiline fields on websites you visit.
                        We process Command Data in real time using our machine learning algorithm to generate outputs. After this

                        When you sign up for QuillBot's premium Services
                        under a Team Plan, we collect personal data from Team Plan Owners, Administrators, and Writers (as defined in
                        our Terms of Service) necessary to administer and operate the Services.

                    <p>
                        If you are a Team Plan Owner, we collect your first and
                        last name and email address. You also have the option to provide us with your phone number, company name,
                        Business Tax Identifier, and address. As Team Plan Owner, you may invite other individuals to join the
                        Team Plan as either an Administrator or Writer. In such a case, we use your name on the email invitation to

                        processed directly by our third-party payment processors. Our payment processors do not share your full payment

                        legal obligations, enforcing and preventing violations of our Terms, to fight spam, protecting or defending our

                        that information would not identify you personally. Applicable storage periods are determined on a case-by-case
                        basis. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider applicable
                        legal requirements, the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm
                        from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes we process your personal
                        information for, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means. We will maintain certain types
                        of personal information for a limited duration. For example, we keep account information like your account
                        email address for as long as your account is in existence, because we need it to operate your account.

                        delete your account: 1) your account information (first and last name, email address, phone number, user type,
                        and any other information you provided on your account) will be deleted from the Scribbr platform, 2) all your
                        uploaded documents and order details will be deleted automatically; this is irrevocable, and you can never use
                        or enter this account again; 3) the Scribbr team will no longer have access to your documents. This means we
                        cannot deal with possible complaints, as we cannot address complaints from deleted accounts.
